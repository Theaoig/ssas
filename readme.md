# Pseudo Mask Anomaly Segmentation

An implementation of 
[A Novel Self-supervised Learning Pretext Task Designed for Anomaly Segmentation]().
[Anomalies Segmentation by Generating Pseudo Masks on Appearence Image and Motion Reprentation]()
Contributions:

- we propose a novel self-supervised learning pretext task, which is different from generation-based methods or commonly contrastive leanring, it generat pseudo mask from other labeled dataset such as CoCo, and every suitable for pixelwise downstream tasks.
- we present an end-to-end anomaly segmenation framework, it has both high speed and accuracy, and with no post-processing.
- our method achieve SOTA in three anomaly detection/segmentation datasets.
