# Pseudo Mask Anomaly Segmentation

An implementation of [A Novel Contrastive Leanring Pretext Task Designed for Anomaly Segmentation]().

Contributions:

- different from common contrastive learning's pretext task, which is usually a classfy task to distinguish alike-img from dislike-img, we propose a segemeation pretext task which used for anomaly segmentation downstream task.
- we present an end-to-end anomaly segmenation framework, it has both high speed and accuracy, and with no post-processing.
- our method achieve SOTA in three anomaly detection datasets.
